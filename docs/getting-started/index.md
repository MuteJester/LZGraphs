# Getting Started

Welcome to LZGraphs! This section will help you get up and running quickly with the library.

## What is LZGraphs?

LZGraphs is a Python library that uses the Lempel-Ziv 76 (LZ76) compression algorithm to create graph representations of T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires. These graphs capture the statistical properties of CDR3 sequences, enabling:

- **Probability estimation** - Calculate the generation probability of any sequence
- **Sequence generation** - Generate new sequences following repertoire statistics
- **Diversity analysis** - Measure repertoire complexity using novel metrics
- **Comparison** - Compare repertoires using graph-based divergence measures
